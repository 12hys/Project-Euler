Project Euler
=============

These are all the problems I've attempted & solved on [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

To run a specific problem, from the root `Project-Euler` directory, run

    pypy -m problems.completed.ProblemNumber

or

    python -m problems.completed.ProblemNumber

Generally, better performance is due to `pypy`.
